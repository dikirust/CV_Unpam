TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: "No such file or directory: datasets/train"
Solution: Make sure you run from CV_Unpam folder
          Check that datasets folder exists

Problem: "Out of memory" error
Solution: Reduce IMG_SIZE to 48 or 32
          Reduce BATCH_SIZE to 8
          Use fewer samples from each class

Problem: Script runs very slowly
Solution: Check if GPU is available
          Reduce image size or batch size
          Close other applications

Problem: Images not found in dataset
Solution: Check image format is .jpg
          Check folder structure matches
          Make sure class names are lowercase

Problem: "ImportError: No module named tensorflow"
Solution: pip install -r requirements.txt
          Check Python version (3.8+)
          Use virtual environment if needed

WHAT'S NEXT (PHASE 2)
================================================================================

After Phase 1 is complete, next step is to create:

     * Abstrak (Abstract) - in Indonesian
     * Pendahuluan (Introduction) - problem statement + solutions
     * Metodologi (Methodology) - architecture + training setup
     * Hasil dan Diskusi (Results) - with all PNG visualizations
     * Kesimpulan (Conclusion) - summary of findings
     * Daftar Pustaka (References) - 5+ years recent papers
   - Convert HTML to DOCX
   - Save as output/report.html and output/report.docx

2. Upload to Mentari
   - Upload report.docx to UAS session
   - Deadline: as per course schedule


KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER
================================================================================

✓ Main script does EVERYTHING automatically
✓ No manual intervention needed after running
✓ All outputs organized in output/ folder
✓ Two architectures properly compared
✓ All metrics calculated and visualized
✓ Models saved for future use
✓ Reproducible results (fixed random seed)
✓ High-quality visualization (300 DPI PNG files)

The comparison clearly shows:
- Custom CNN: Good baseline, educational value
- MobileNetV2: Better accuracy, faster training, production-ready
